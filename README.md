# Traffic Signs

**Traffic** signs it's an android application for drivers. It can recognize traffic signs in real time with the help of camera and a convolutional neural network.
Also It's a knowledge developer application where you can easily read and learn about traffic signs of the *everyday life*.

## Usage

You need to have an android development environment (**android studio**) to use the application.

Clone the project and start it! Select the live mode when it needed.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

It's a *future development* but you wil capture photos about **traffic signs** in order to help the precision of the *neural network*.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

## Features

- Classify traffic signs in real time
- Capture a traffic sign and see details
- Show history of classified traffic signs
- List of traffic sign groups, *ex: Warning signs, Information signs, ...*
- Search the interested sign
- List all of the traffic signs by group *(List / Grid)* in a user friendly way
- Read about and get to know the selected traffic sign *(name, description, read more in a specific link)
- Handle your own profile
- Read about your known signs or delete them
- Quick Quiz with traffic signs and names

## Future Development

- Create an object detection neural network instead of image classifier
- Speed sensing and warning for driver
- Map / GPS
- Installation of video recording for optional use, so we can have evidence of a situation
- Recognition, communication to driver of other types of road signs
- Romanian/ Hungarian language
- Enable Landscape mod
- Using audio, for example, warnings will be sound recordings, so we don 't distract the driver
- Development of visual surface
